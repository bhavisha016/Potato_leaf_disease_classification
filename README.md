Potato Leaf Disease Classification Using CNN
This repository contains a project for classifying potato leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to identify whether a potato leaf is healthy or affected by specific diseases, helping farmers take timely action to protect crops.

ðŸŒŸ Project Overview
Potato plants are susceptible to various diseases, which can significantly impact crop yield. This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify potato leaf images into distinct categories, such as:

Healthy
Early Blight
Late Blight
A CNN model is trained on a dataset of potato leaf images to achieve high accuracy in classification.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains images of potato leaves labeled as healthy or diseased.
